This is a project that allows you to play Xiangqi, also known as the Chinese Chess.
It has its own rules. for more: https://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/whats_new/rules/Xiangqi.html
The output is shown in the terminal.
it can save and load the current game both in binary and nonbinary form.
In the end the winner and the points they earned are shown.
There are specific rules in Xiangqi and they prevent some moves from being played.
The project prints "hatali hareket" in the case of an imposible move.
The input should be entered as in the "main file".
IMPORTANT NOTICE:: PLEASE PLAY THIS GAME USING THE INTELLIJ IDE.
USING ONLY JAVAC TO COMPILE MAY CREATE AN ERROR WITH THE NON ASCII CHARACTER "Åž" THAT CAUSE COMPILATION ERRORS. ALSO THE GAME BOARD SEEMS BETTER AT INTELLIJ 
Have fun! Thank you for your interest in this project!
